# Context Free Glamour

## Project Explanation
Python interpreter using Jison.

"Jison takes a context-free grammar as input and outputs a JavaScript file capable of parsing the language described by that grammar." https://zaa.ch/jison/docs/

## Team Members
The members of Context Free Glamour are Callum Ferguson, Conrad Bucholtz, Keegan Welch, and Joseph Vitale.

## Interpreter Requirements
This code interprets a limited set of Python features including:
*Comments
*If/else statements
*While/for loops
*Variables
*Arithmetic Operators
*Assignment Operators
*Conditional Statements
*Limited python built-in functions (print, str, int)
*Concatenation
*Syntax Errors

## How to Use
To use the interpreter, first navigate to the live code [here](http://pythoninterpreter.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/). 
Enter your python code into the text box and press the "run" button. 
If you would like to test the interpeter using our sample code, press the "Sample Script" button. To test a syntax error, press "Sample Syntax Error". To clear the input from the text box, press "Clear Input".
